# VTKBasedPrimitiveCADModeller

## Overview
This project aims to develop a CAD Modeller application using VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and Activiz.NET, allowing users to create and manipulate primitive shapes like circle, point, arc, line, and ellipse. The application will have two main modes: Sketch Mode and View Mode. In Sketch Mode, users can draw shapes, while in View Mode, users can view and manipulate the drawn shapes.

## Features
- **Primitive Shapes**: Users can draw primitive shapes such as circle, point, arc, line, and ellipse.
- **Sketch Mode**: Allows users to draw shapes freely. In this mode, users cannot zoom in or out.
- **View Mode**: Enables users to zoom in, zoom out, and manipulate the drawn shapes.
- **Plane Selection**: Users can select XY, YZ, or XZ planes for drawing shapes.
- **Delete Functionality**: Provides a delete button to remove selected shapes.
- **Save Functionality**: Allows users to save the drawn shapes to a file.

## Requirements
- **Windows Operating System**
- **Visual Studio**: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed to open and build the project.
- **Activiz.NET**: Install Activiz.NET, which provides .NET bindings for VTK.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohitChandajkar/VTKBasedPrimitiveCADModeller.git
   ```
2. **Open Project in Visual Studio**: Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. **Install Activiz.NET**: If not already installed, install Activiz.NET by following the installation instructions provided on the official website.
4. **Build Solution**: Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
5. **Run the Application**: Start the application from Visual Studio.

## Usage
1. **Sketch Mode**: Upon launching the application, it will start in Sketch Mode. Here, users can draw primitive shapes freely.
2. **View Mode**: Switch to View Mode to manipulate and view the drawn shapes. Use zoom in, zoom out, and pan functionalities to adjust the view.
3. **Plane Selection**: Select the desired plane (XY, YZ, or XZ) for drawing shapes.
4. **Delete**: Use the delete button to remove selected shapes from the drawing.
5. **Save**: Save the drawn shapes to a file by clicking the save button.
